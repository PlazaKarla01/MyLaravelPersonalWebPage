                    <p class="text-7">I envision myself becoming more skilled, efficient, and professional in the next 6 years. I want to spend the next several years learning new skills, taking on demanding work, working on various projects, contributing as much as I can, and putting in the effort to see myself advance to the next level.
                         I feel that my hard work enables me to be a better version of myself, and I wanted to perceive myself in a positive light. It might be an fashion designer, or a graphic designer.Honestly, I have no idea what will happen in the next six years because there is nothing particular I want to be and I don't picture myself in any sort of work/career today, but there are two jobs that I would like to have in the future.
                        And I learnt to take it easy and be patient because It's alright to not know some things. And thereâ€™s no advantage to rushing through life and there are a lot of opportunities everywhere. Also remember to look at hardships as opportunities and challenges as gifts.
